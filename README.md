# Cell-Physics
A 2D tile-based Particle Physics Simulator. This is a project I'll eventually finish, as it's just my guess on how Physics interactions
work. There exists standardized math for describing how Physics works on this scale, but I'm avoiding reading them so I can 
figure it out for myself.
